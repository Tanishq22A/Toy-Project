# Placement Prediction using IQ and CGPA 🎓🤖

This is a toy machine learning project that predicts student placement status based on two features: **IQ** and **CGPA**. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how simple AI/ML models can be applied to real-world-inspired classification tasks.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a binary classification model that predicts whether a student will be placed or not using their IQ and CGPA scores.

## 🔍 Features Used

- **IQ** (Intelligence Quotient): A numerical measure of a student’s intelligence.
- **CGPA** (Cumulative Grade Point Average): Academic performance score.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if included)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## 📊 Machine Learning Models

The project uses basic ML classification algorithms like:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

You can compare the accuracy of different models to select the best one.

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset is synthetic/toy and consists of student records with the following columns:

- `IQ`: A numerical value representing IQ.
- `CGPA`: Academic score on a 10-point scale.
- `Placement`: Binary label (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision / Recall / F1-Score
